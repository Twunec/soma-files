Soma Client - A beta (we believe) version of the MoS client. It's missing things like sound and armature but could be an ideal way to work on a client in
a simplified (albeit basic way).

Inside this folder is a sub folder called 'Run' which is where the limited assets are.

Soma Tools - The executable this builds loads a series of buttons to manage the visual representation aspects of graphics and artwork. For e.g. designing a map
with tile sets, creating tilesets, converting images to soma's native image format (16 bit bmp with a custom header - .spl). This tool is pretty raw and undeveloped.

Feel free to create your own project for either of these and should you wish to, advertise it here fur contribution? :-)
