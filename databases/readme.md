# Databases

## Recommended development database (from 3.0 server files)

This is the database that was maintained on the Somadev forum until its closure as a result it had lots of fixes over the years

Original context: http://somadev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=1977&start=50#p55461

This DB has esoma rates and is at time of writing probably the best database to start a fresh server from

## Esoma characters Database 

This database was donated to the project by Remix 

It contains esoma character data but no account information

This is a DB from old versions of MSSQL and because of its size you might not get away with just the express version of MSSQL

Please keep in mind it's very raw and not a database we support in any capacity it is here mostly in case there is an interest in the data

If you want to use this data for a server we'd recommend porting it into a modern development DB and be prepared for issues

It is possible to do, it's been done in the past but would need a lot of dedication by a developer
