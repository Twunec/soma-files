map 22 crashed on first import, subsequent loads are fine :S 
http://d.pr/7BV2
Update - seems to crash randomly on import 




Mouse cursor seems to desync with the tile position when placing, seems occur when moving between monitors
that the desync occurs

using a 1920 x 1080 monitor on the left and a 1280 x 1024 monitor on the right

Update - seems this happens even when working on one monitor, the further right you go on the monitor
the further misaligned the cursor is to the tile, I'll disable my secondary monitor to see if it still happens

update - okay since disabling the second monitor the editor has stopped loading tiles: http://d.pr/OOwx
File structure has not changed: http://d.pr/TH9a replacing the map files with clean ones does not seem to fix it
I'll carry on debugging after a restart as that might fix it, I assume the application isn't saving settings to
the registry or %appdata% atm 







Might be an idea to have the application generate a log on crash?
